### About me personally

When I not looking at a computer screen or [book](/books), I am usually exercising, hanging with friends, or walking around aimlessly listening to [podcasts](/podcasts).

### About me professionally

I currently work as a data scientist at Boeing. Previously I was at NC State where I received a Masters in Operations Research. I also received a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a minor in Statistics. Here are some [projects](/projects) I worked on while at NCSU. During my ~5 years at NCSU I tried to specialize in programming and mathematics rooted in problem solving. I was also a teaching assistant for 4 years for the various programming courses in the ISE/OR department. I think one day I would like to return to teaching. I also worked in the [DIME Lab](https://www.dimelab.org/) under Dr. Starly.
