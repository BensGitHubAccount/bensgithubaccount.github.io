### Projects I worked on while at NC State

- A Case Study for [Blockchain in Manufacturing: "FabRec": A Prototype for Peer-to-Peer Network of Manufacturing Nodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01083).
- Senior Capstone Project: [Optimizing Bus Routes for Boston Public Schools](/files/SCP.pdf)
- I wrote a paper on [Modeling Bitcoin Mining as a Stochastic Process](/files/BMSP.pdf) for my stochastic processes class. There are some errors in the paper such as the omission of time-rolling to increase the total number of possible block hashes, but the overall math and logic is sound.
